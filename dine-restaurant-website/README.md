## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package//validator) - Validator package
- [ReactIcons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - React Icons

### What I learned

I have learned about new hooks such as useReducer, useEffect, useContext and React Router. I also learned about Form components and validations.
I worked with layout design and mobile first approach.

### Continued development

I want to focus on building pixel perfect layouts, scale css projects and continue to explore more css frameworks. I also want to learn more about performance on react and accessibility. On this project I will improve the form validaton and the css architecture. Also I will improve code readability on react components.
