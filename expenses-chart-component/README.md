## My process

My process was quicker than my first and second project. I saw an improvement on how to read the briefing and how to approach the challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Chart JS

### What I learned

This was my third project and I tried to work against time. I explored and acknowledged new tools on the fly and I manage to almost replicate the design and the functionality of this app. It was a small project but it was fun to work with the dataset on Chart JS.
