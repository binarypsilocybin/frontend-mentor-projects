## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### What I learned

I worked against the time again with this project. I had some issues with the card on mobile viewport and I had issues with dark mode. I had to find a good solution for both topics which took me more time than I wanted to spare.

I learned how to tackle design problems and I learned how to manipulate data and also how to filter data and clear inputs.

### Continued development

I will keep training my API calls and data manipulation. Also I want to improve my CSS skills.

### Useful resources

- [Dark Mode](https://www.ditdot.hr/en/dark-mode-website-tutorial) I used this solution which worked perfectly with JS and some DOM manipulation.
