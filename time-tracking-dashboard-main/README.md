## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I struggled to understand the layout and was a hard to understand the responsive design. I opted for the actual layout because it looked better for me. I search a lot about other solutions and I think these cards expanding was not a good lookig solution. I learned a lot about grid and grid rows.
