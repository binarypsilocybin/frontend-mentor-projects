## My process

This one was pretty straight forward. First I made the card, applied all the styles and worked with dummy data. Then I called the endpoint and worked the data into the card via DOM.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- API calls

### What I learned

I learned how to quick call an API and get the data and learned more about hoisting and click evend handlers. It was a pretty easy app but it was fun.

### Continued development

I want to continue to train the API Calls area and learn how to manipulate data.
