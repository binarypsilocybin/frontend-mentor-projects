## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I learned how to work and style input range and how to build this kind of range slider component based on data.

### Useful resources

- [Code in Public](https://github.com/coding-in-public) - This helped me to understand the logic for both options monthly and annually. I really liked this logic and the range slider solution worked for me.
