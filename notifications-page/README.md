## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

This process was easier and quicker than my first challenge.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JS DOM

### What I learned

This was my second challenge and I recalled a lot of things about semantic HTML. I improved a lot since first challenge.

- Javascript DOM manipulations
- Flex
- HTML Semantic

### Continued development

I want to recall HTML Semantic and CSS architectures as well to improve my manipulation of DOM skills.
